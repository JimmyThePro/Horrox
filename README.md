# JS/React, by Jimmy Junttila

## HORROX

A horror movie app, built with React.
This website give users information about horror movies.

- 'Heroimage' is showing a random horror movie.
- 'Top Rated' horror movies is shown under heroimage as a slider with sidescroll function.
- 'Popular' horror movies is shown as a second slider with sidescroll function.
- User can see 'Recently Viewed' as a third slider with sidescroll function, with movies he/she recently clicked on.
- All movies are linked to TMDB's movie detail page.
- User can search for movies, working as a 'live search' (no need to submit).

## Future updates

(Under construction...)

- Add 'TV series' as an option for the user.
- Change to IMDB's API instead, so user can search for horror movies only (TMDB's API do not have this option).
- Add trailers on all movies, showing in a modal-popup.
- Add social media links.
- More 'issues' to come...
